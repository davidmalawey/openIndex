OpenAir is a collection of solutions for pneumatics design projects, with free designs, available parts, and robust, measurable performance. Compared with other open-source designs, this project is more digestible for learners of fundamentals. Here, youâ€™ll find modules instead of applications. Or possibly, full applications from which users can borrow components & concepts to as assets in new projects.
