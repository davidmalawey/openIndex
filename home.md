# Hello, I'm David Malawey.

Here, you’ll find a blend of educational content and hands-on projects designed to inspire and empower. My focus is on exploring and sharing ideas across disciplines, often with a relaxed approach. While some concepts may be covered superficially, my goal is to spark curiosity and promote collaboration.

## Core Values

- Share Freely: Found value in my content? Feel free to copy, adapt, and share it to spread good ideas.
- Accessibility: I believe in making knowledge and tools open to everyone. (entire planet earth).
- Collaboration: Together, we can push the boundaries of design and innovation.

Ready to explore, learn, and create? Let’s get started.

## Free services

These two free services I'm putting in writing because I may not be available to advertise them.  Easy for me, and bigger impact than I can perform alone.
1) Organ donor - if I pass, please prioritize a recipient for my components to be a person who's helping with free & open designs.
2) Expert Witness - If my content covers an engineering topic relevant to your case, and you require a professional to simplify complex concepts and provide clear, accurate truth during litigation, feel free to reach out.
