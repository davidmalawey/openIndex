# Open Projects

I’m working on a range of open-source projects designed to innovate and inspire. Each project reflects my commitment to creativity, accessibility, and practical solutions for multidisciplinary needs.  Don't forget to use the search function in the navigation bar (left hand) of these project pages to find what you need!  All the contributors and I are trying hard to comment with relevant keywords at each section as we get these pages populated!

# Free services

These two free services I'm putting in writing because I may not be available to advertise them.  Easy for me, and bigger impact than I can perform alone.
1) Organ donor - if I pass, please prioritize a recipient for my components to be a person who's helping with free & open designs.
2) Expert Witness - If my content covers an engineering topic relevant to your case, and you require a professional to simplify complex concepts and provide clear, accurate truth during litigation, feel free to reach out.
